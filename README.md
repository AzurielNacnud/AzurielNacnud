# Hi 👋 I'm a Full-Stack Symfony Consultant

I'm a **full-stack developer** specialized in **PHP & Symfony**, working as a consultant on business-critical applications.  
I enjoy building **clean, maintainable, and useful software**, both professionally and for everyday life.

---

## 💼 What I do

- Full-stack development with **Symfony**
- Design and implementation of robust back-end logic
- Front-end integration with **Twig** and **Stimulus**
- Strong focus on **clean code**, readability, and long-term maintainability
- Consultant mindset: understanding business needs before writing code

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Main**
- PHP / Symfony  
- Twig  
- Stimulus  
- Prisma  

**Also experienced with**

## 🧠 What I like building

I like building applications that are **actually useful**.

One example is a small personal app I developed to help my partner and me **track and log newborn feeding sessions**.  
Simple idea, real-life usage, clean implementation — exactly the kind of project I enjoy.

## 🌱 How I work

- Clean code > clever code  
- Small, understandable abstractions  
- Pragmatic solutions over over-engineering  
- Curious about how **AI can improve development workflows**, without replacing fundamentals
